                        I am Prachee Sarkar, a senior Computer Science major. I am currently working towards my
                        bachelor's degree at CCNY and hope to pursue a career in app development in the future. Some projects 
                        I have worked on in the past include a recipe catalogue, a food ordering system, and a democratic election
                        simulator. My current projects include a lost & found website and a 3D segmentation API.
